# About Simply Recipes

This project features reverse engineering **[John Smilga's](https://johnsmilga.com/) Simply Recipes website** using
Django and HTMX.

The Data used to populate the database are mainly fetched from [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/) **API** and later
will be fixed manually by the help of AI or by seeking other options in the future.

The MealDB API was only a temporary solution to populate the database with real values, but surely the recipe's
data source will evolve later to be submitted by User and verified by Admin.
